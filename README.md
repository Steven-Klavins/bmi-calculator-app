# bmi-calculator-app
A BMI calculator app for android devices, built in Android and java

**Possible future improvements** 
At present the app can only calculate BMI in KG, I feel it would be useful to have an option to select different units of measurement. The app also at present has no testing, so adding some testing is something intend to do. I have however conducted manual feature tests to ensure I was getting the expected behavior from the app.

APK file to be added shortly
